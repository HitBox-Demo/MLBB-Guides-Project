                <p>Introduction to Mobile Legend Bang Bang, its story, and setting.</p>
                <p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) is a mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Chinese developer Moonton,
                    a subsidiary of ByteDance. The game was released in 2016 and grew in popularity, most prominently in Southeast Asia.
                </p><p>
                    At its base gameplay, the game puts 2 teams of 5 against each other in real time with at least 20-60 second matchmaking and 10-30 minute matches. 
                    Featuring traditional battle arena gameplay, players must fight over three lanes to take the enemy's tower and defend their own while securing objectives 
                    in order to pressure the opposing team. Like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training to level up or pay to play angle—winners and losers are decided based 
                    on skill, ability, and strategy</p>

                <p>Detailed explanation of the gameplay mechanics.</p>
                <div><p>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game designed for mobile phones. 
                    The game is free-to-play and is only monetized through in-game purchases like characters and skins. 
                    Each player can control a selectable character, called a Hero, with unique abilities and traits. 
                    There are six roles that define the main purpose of heroes: Tank, Marksman, Assassin, Fighter, Mage, and Support. 
                    These roles determine the responsibilities of players for their respective teams. Players can also set specific builds 
                    for heroes which include in-game items and emblems.</p>

                    <h5>Ranked and Classic</h5>
                    <p>Two teams of five players go against each other in real-time. Players will be matched in correspondence with their current ranking. 
                        There are seven ranks in the game with Warrior being the lowest followed by Elite, Master, Grandmaster, Epic, Legend, and the highest rank, Mythic.
                        A player can only invite and form a team with other players of similar rank or players that are one rank higher or lower.</p>

                    <P>The game involves three lanes: gold lane, exp lane, and mid lane, with the jungle between each lane. 
                        Players must attack the enemy base by destroying opposing turrets in at least one lane. 
                        Minions help in attacking lane-by-lane, and destroying all turrets in one or all lanes increases the chances of destroying the opposite team's base.</P>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="section-title">Tips & Tricks</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>1. Constantly look at your map</h4>
                <p>The so-called mini-map is the small map at the top right corner of the screen. 
                    With its help, we now can know our team's position but, more importantly, our enemy's position.<br>
                    If we keep an eye on the minimap, we can avoid being ganked or alert our team of a potential enemy ganks. 
                    The main reason PRO players are ranking up so easily is that they look at the map every 5-10 seconds, 
                    which gives them a better understanding of the enemy's positioning and strategy.</p>
                <h4>2. Know the META</h4>
                <p>META is also known as most effective tactics available, Most of the low-rank players keep playing old meta, 
                    which is the most common mistake they can make. PRO players know the META, and they always play according to it.<br>
                    How to make an understanding of META? It's easy. Just look at the patch notes after every update or go and watch different professional players</p>
                <h4>3. Turrets before kills</h4>
                <p>Many player would do everything for kills, but that's not the goal. Mobile Legends is a game where you can win only by destroying towers and not by getting more kills.<br>
                    What do the professional players do? If the enemy has low HP, they don't chase for kills inside their territory. Letting them recall is the same as killing them. 
                    The more you destroy their turrets and stealing their jungle, the easier it will get to win.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Ganking</h4>
                <p>Now, since you look at the minimap constantly, you can practice ganking without losing turrets. When you want to gank, you always have to communicate and make sure it's at least 4 of you, 
                    so you have a higher chance of winning the gank without deaths, and everyone can go back to their lanes</p>
